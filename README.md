Set of deep learning algorithms for geometrical coordinates prediction for point clouds.

Original work was done to predict the H-point(Hip point) coordinates from a seat structure but the same can be extended for other use cases also.
Modification of the original Pointnet,Pointnet++,DGCNN and Gapnet models are presented for the required project case and can be extended as per the user's requirements
